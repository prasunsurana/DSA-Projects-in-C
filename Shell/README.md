# Homework 5

This is the starting readme for this assignment.  Please edit the following information by removing the "*edit me*" and replace it with appropriate information your assignment. If it is asking you a question, please provide a response.

- Name: Prasun
- Description: HW05 - Processes and Mini Shell
- How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? >30 hours
- Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell us who and in what capacity.
  - I collaborated with my TA Theresa Todd who helped me to write the parse function.
- Did you use any external resources? (Cite them below)
  - CodeVault (YouTube)
  - StackOverFlow
- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment? 
  - I found this homework very difficult. Conceptually, I also did not fully understand pipes, and even though I understood fork and exec, I had a very difficult time implementing it. My basic program at the start was working alright, but after I added the pipes, it started producing segmentation faults even though I did not malloc anything in that section. Because of a lack of time, I had to submit what I had. 
- (Optional) How would you improve the assignment? 
  - For the previous assignments, I feel like the gap between the homeworks and the tutorials was challenging but manageable. I felt like the leap between the tutorials for this week and this assignment was very large and was very difficult to plug the holes in my understanding.

## Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.

## Important notes

* Your code **must compile and run** on the Khoury machines to earn credit. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we grade your assignments.
* You must commit any additional files(if any) into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* Do not forget, once you have pushed your changes to your repo make sure that you **submit them to Gradescope before the assignment deadline!**
