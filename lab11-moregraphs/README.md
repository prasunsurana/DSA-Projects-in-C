# Lab 11

This is the starting readme for this assignment.  Please edit the following information by removing the "*edit me*" and replace it with appropriate information your assignment. If it is asking you a question, please provide a response.

- Name: Prasun Surana

- Description: Lab11 - More Graphs. We had to implement 3 functions; one to check if there is a path between two nodes, one to check the graph for cycles, and the last to print a path between two nodes.

- How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? 18

- Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell us who and in what capacity.
  - I collaborated with TAs Matthew and Shirali. I had written my is_reachable function and consulted Matthew when I was getting a segmentation fault, but we were not able to fix it. Later, I managed to successfuly debug it. I got Shirali's help for the has_cycle function as well as to look through my is_reachable function code.

- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment? 
  - Finishing it! This lab was far more difficult than other labs and it took me a very long time to systematize the steps in the algorithm I used, especially for the print function. When my code finally worked, it was very satisfying.

- (Optional) How would you improve the assignment? 
  - *edit me*

## Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.

## Important notes

* Your code **must compile and run** on the Khoury machines to earn credit. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we grade your assignments.
* You must commit any additional files(if any) into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* Do not forget, once you have pushed your changes to your repo make sure that you **submit them to Gradescope before the assignment deadline!**
