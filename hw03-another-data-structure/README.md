# Homework 3

This is the starting readme for this assignment.  Please edit the following information by removing the "*edit me*" and replace it with appropriate information your assignment. If it is asking you a question, please provide a response.

- Name: Prasun Surana
- Title: HW03 - Another Data Structure
- How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? 24 
- Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell us who and in what capacity.
  - I collaborated with Theresa Todd, a TA for this semester's class. I wrote all of my functions, but when I ran the unit tests, I ran into a segmentation fault. Theresa helped me to troubleshoot, and also helped me to make some minor changes to my code that made it more streamlined and readable. 
- Did you use any external resources? (Cite them below)
  - Jacob Sorber - Youtube
  - CS50 - Youtube
  - mycodeschool - Youtube
  - StackOverflow
- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment? 
  - My favourite part of the assignment was learning the logic of how linked lists worked.If someone asks me how I could create such a data structure, I would never be able to imagine it myself, but when I learn about it, it always fascinates me as to how every problem in computer science can be broken down into logical constituents. I quite enjoyed writing the functions as well. Although it was frustrating at first because I felt like I did not understand how to use pointers in structs, once I got over that obstacle, and I gained a little momentum, the code writing became far more enjoyable. 
- (Optional) How would you improve the assignment? 
  - I think the assignment was very instructive overall. I have found so far that since the homeworks can be a little unrelated to the tutorials for the week, it can be quite stressful to piece everything together yourself. This would not be too much of a problem, but in my unique circumstance so far, I have been trying to catch up to the rest of the class, so that time pressure was a little more pronounced for me personally. Now that I am caught up, I do not think this should be too much of an issue. While it is challenging, I did find that the more I was forced to think of solutions myself and do my own research, the more I learned and remembered. 

## Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.

### Important notes

* Your code **must compile and run** on the Khoury machines to earn credit. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we grade your assignments.
* You must commit any additional files(if any) into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* Do not forget, once you have pushed your changes to your repo make sure that you **submit them to Gradescope before the assignment deadline!**
