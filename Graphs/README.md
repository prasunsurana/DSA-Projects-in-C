This is the starting readme for this assignment.  Please edit the following information by removing the "*edit me*" and replace it with appropriate information your assignment. If it is asking you a question, please provide a response.

- Name: Prasun Surana

- Description: HW10 - Graphs. We had to implement a graph structure using adjacency lists.

- How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? 16

- Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell us who and in what capacity.
  - I collaborated with my TA Theresa Todd, as well as another TA Matthew Faucher. Theresa helped me to write my find_node, free_graph and remove_node functions. After that, I implemented my functions myself but some of my functions were very inefficient as they used nested for loops. I consulted Matthew and he helped me to find a more elegant solution.

- Did you use any external resources? (Cite them below)
  - I did not use any external resources for this assignment

- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment? 
  - This assignment was very challenging, as I struggled to understand the structure of the graph and the doubly linked lists. However, once I understood it, I enjoyed implementing the functions as it was a good mental challenge. 

- (Optional) How would you improve the assignment? 
  - *edit me*

## Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.

## Important notes

* Your code **must compile and run** on the Khoury machines to earn credit. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we grade your assignments.
* You must commit any additional files(if any) into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* Do not forget, once you have pushed your changes to your repo make sure that you **submit them to Gradescope before the assignment deadline!**
