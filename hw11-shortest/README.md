# Homework 11

This is the starting readme for this assignment.  Please edit the following information by removing the "*edit me*" and replace it with appropriate information your assignment. If it is asking you a question, please provide a response.

- Name: Prasun Surana

- Description: HW11 - Shortest Path. We had to implement Dijkstra's Algorithm using a priority queue.

- How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? 30

- Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell us who and in what capacity.
  - I collaborated slightly with Matthew and Shirali for this assignment, but we were not able to solve some of the errors I was getting. I went to Professor Jump afterwards and she helped me a lot with plugging my memory leaks as well as other errors I was facing in my priority queue.

- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment? 
  - My favourite part of this assignment was finishing it! I found this assignment very frustrating, because even though once I had understood how the algorithm worked, and had written all my code, I was getting some errors which I had real trouble fixing, especially memory leaks. Once I finished the assignment, I was very relieved to see that it worked.

- (Optional) How would you improve the assignment? 
  - *edit me*

## Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.

## Important notes

* Your code **must compile and run** on the Khoury machines to earn credit. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we grade your assignments.
* You must commit any additional files(if any) into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* Do not forget, once you have pushed your changes to your repo make sure that you **submit them to Gradescope before the assignment deadline!**
