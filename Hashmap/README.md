# Homework 4

This is the starting readme for this assignment.  Please edit the following information by removing the "*edit me*" and replace it with appropriate information your assignment. If it is asking you a question, please provide a response.

- Name: Prasun Surana
- Description: HW04 - Hashmaps
- How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? 14
- Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell us who and in what capacity.
  - I collaborated with my TA Theresa Todd. I had written the code for most of the functions except for the free and remove functions. I was having trouble understanding how to implement the remove function in particular, and Theresa helped me to conceptualize and formulate this part of my program. I met with her during my weekly office hours slot at 2.30pm on Monday. 
- Did you use any external resources? (Cite them below)
  - I did not use any external resources for this assignment. I mainly relied on my implementation in the previous homework assignment to refresh my memory on operations on linked lists.
  - 
- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment? 
  - I enjoyed all parts of this assignment. I really enjoy the process of starting from a simple model, and little by little, writing the functions and watching it come together to make a functional data structure.
- (Optional) How would you improve the assignment? 
  - I would not improve anything about this assignment. 

## Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.

### Important notes

* Your code **must compile and run** on the Khoury machines to earn credit. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we grade your assignments.
* You must commit any additional files(if any) into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* Do not forget, once you have pushed your changes to your repo make sure that you **submit them to Gradescope before the assignment deadline!**
